        <h1>Why are children at such a risk</h1>
        <a>Children are at such a high risk due to their social contact. What that means is the amount of people in which children come in contact with throughout any given day.  Another factor in that is the amount of time in which they spend with other people, be it other children, teachers, etc.</a>
        <h1>What can you (The Parents) do preemptively</h1>
        <a>Proper Hygiene is <strong>HUGE</strong> in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.  Going over proper hand washing technique, showering regularely, brushing teeth, etc. Another less communicated way is teaching younger children to stay away from hot spots. What I mean by this is touching their eyes, mouth, ears, nose and open wounds.  These are all easy way for bacteria and other harmful things to enter the body. </a>
